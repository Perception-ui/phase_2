    "In this section, we will explore the King County House Sales dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the predictor variables and their potential influence on the target variable, **price**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in a house represents its capacity to accommodate occupants and may have a significant impact on its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms ties to the convenience and functionality of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sqft_living**: The square footage of the living space provides an estimate of the overall size and spaciousness of the house, which can be a determining factor for buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sqft_lot**: The size of the lot influences desirability and prospect of expansion or outdoor amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **floors**: The number of floors in a house affect its layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **waterfront**: Whether a house is located on a waterfront can significantly impact its desirability and exclusivity, potentially leading to higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **view**: The quality of the view from a house, such as scenic landscapes or city skylines, can be a sought-after feature that affects its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **condition**: The overall condition of a house, reflecting its maintenance and upkeep, can influence buyer perception and potentially impact pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **grade**: The grade assigned to a house based on its construction and design quality can be an indicator of its overall value and prestige.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **yr_built**: The year when a house was built can be relevant to buyers seeking historical charm or considering potential renovation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **yr_renovated**: The year of the most recent renovation can indicate the modernization or upgrades made to the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on their potential impact on house prices and relevance to the target variable, the predictor variables will guide the subsequent steps of the project, including data preparation, feature selection, and model development.\n"

Columns measuring area are redundant, with other variables already present in the dataset.
